      <p>
        In this project, I harnessed the concept of optical illusion to craft an animated image that gives the impression of dots, each displayed in two distinct colors, in apparent motion along a grid of lines, despite their actual static positions.

        Design Process

      <p>
        In this code, I initiated the process by constructing a grid of dots with a predefined spacing, achieved through the utilization of nested for loops. Among the two most prevalent grids used for optical illusions, namely the Hermann grid and the scintillating grid, I opted for the Hermann grid to establish a structured foundation. Subsequently, I employed the dots to generate the scintillating illusion. To enhance the effect, I introduced a subtle random offset to the position of each dot in a secondary set of nested for loops. This manipulation created the optical illusion that the dots are in motion within the grid. Also, the dots are seemingly connected in pairs, resembling the appearance of doubled groups of dots - this further contributes to the overall impact of the optical illusion.

       Optical illusions are deployed in the world for entertainment, art, advertising, architecture, psychology research, education, virtual reality, product design, safety, medical applications, and more, enhancing visual experiences, communication, and understanding of human perception. In our daily lives, optical illusions are used in road signs and other safety features to grab the attention of drivers and pedestrians, especially in situations where quick perception is essential. As I have a background in architecture, to me, optical illusions can also be employed to manipulate the perception of space and depth. For example, architects may use patterns and materials to make a room appear larger or smaller than it actually is. For this project, I tried to combine my two understandings of optical illusion by placing the bouncing dots on a grided layout.
