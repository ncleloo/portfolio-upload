        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        This clock is an experimental timepiece that conveys the passage of time through the progression of a continuous half-circle. The lines commence from the left side of the clock, and as they reach the midpoint of the "timer," it signifies noon. When the entire line is completely filled, it signifies the end of the day.
      </p>

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        I conceived this clock design with the purpose of visually representing the passage of time as it unfolds within the motion of an uninterrupted fan-like movement. My aim was to challenge the conventional perception of time by incorporating three distinct "primary" stopping points in the display.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
       Upon reflection, I believe this clock has the potential to reshape the way people manage their time, as it encourages a shift in lifestyle. By featuring only three key time markers, it encourages individuals to organize their day into two distinct segments: one dedicated to productivity and the other to leisure. This design promotes a departure from the traditional hourly planning, offering a more efficient and balanced approach to time management.
