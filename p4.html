        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        This clock is an experimental timepiece that conveys the passage of time through the progression of changing shapes and colors. The idea behidn this design is that time passes by quickly and one's emotions and mood can change in seconds.

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        I conceived this clock design with the purpose of visually representing the passage of time as it unfolds within the motion of flipping through a film roll of photos. My aim was to challenge the conventional perception of time by incorporating the idea of moments and memories using this movement. I coded a series of abstract shapes as an unusual representation of the current time, and then designed the movements with the shapes changing every second to give the idea that each second is a moment that could be precious.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
       Upon reflection, I believe this clock has the potential to reshape the way people manage their time, as it encourages a shift in lifestyle. By featuring only abstract time markers, it encourages individuals to organize their day into distinct segments: one dedicated to productivity and the other to leisure, etc etc. This design promotes a departure from the traditional hourly planning, offering a more efficient and balanced approach to time management.
